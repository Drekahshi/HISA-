/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Veridi
 * @version Prototyping
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and a more open model for CFAs, allowing public read access with owner-only writes. Tree planting records are restricted to the user only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Each user can only read/write their own profile.
 * - /cfas/{cfaId}: Stores CFA information. Publicly readable, but only owners can create, update, or delete.
 * - /users/{userId}/treePlantingRecords/{recordId}: Stores tree planting records for the specific user. Only the user can read/write their own records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles and tree planting records.
 * - CFA information is publicly readable but only modifiable by an owner (based on an `ownerId` field that MUST be added to the CFA schema).
 * - Listing of documents is generally allowed within user-owned subcollections.
 * - No data shape validation is performed beyond ownership checks during writes (to enable rapid prototyping).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `User` entity's `cfaId` field denormalizes CFA information onto user profiles, avoiding the need for `get()` calls in security rules.
